Coding Assignment for Integral

THe program can be run by running the IntegralProjectApplication file. However, very little user functionality is ready after the two hour limit. Most time was spent preparing the DAO layer for use by the client side of the application.

THe project uses a Spring and a JDBC framework to connect to a postgres database. This database holds Users, Posts, and Followings relationally. Future function implementation would allow a user to utilize these database calls to view and create posts, as well as follow new users.
